DTI-Reg is an open-source C++ application that performs pair-wise DTI registration by using scalar FA map to drive the registration:
 1/ Method one: registration via BRAINSFit/BRAINSDemonWarp
 2/ Method two: registration via ANTS (Advanced Normalization Tools)

Individual steps of the pair-wise registration pipeline are performed via external applications (some of them being 3D Slicer modules) called by a BatchMake script. Starting with two input DTI images, scalar FA maps are generated via DiffusionTensorMathematics. Registration is then performed between these FA maps, via BRAINSFit/BRAINSDemonWarp or ANTS (Advanced Normalization Tools), which provide different registration schemes: rigid, affine, BSpline, diffeomorphic, logDemons. The final deformation is then applied to the source DTI image via ResampleDTI.
